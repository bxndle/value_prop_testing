    <h3>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h3>

    Fair Information Practices

    The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.

    In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:
    We will notify you via email and via in-site notification within 7 business days.

    We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.

    <h3>CAN SPAM Act</h3>

    The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.

    We collect your email address in order to:
      <ul>
        <li>Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions</li>
        <li>Process orders and to send information and updates pertaining to orders.</li>
        <li>Market to our mailing list or continue to send emails to our clients after the original transaction has occurred.</li>
      </ul>
    To be in accordance with CANSPAM, we agree to the following:
      <ul>
        <li>Not use false or misleading subjects or email addresses.</li>
        <li>Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way.</li>
        <li>Include the physical address of our business or site headquarters.</li>
        <li>Monitor third-party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used.</li>

      </ul>
